# pyname
renames files in a directory, built for Plex media management

This script works by taking a user input (name of media being managed)(case sensitive), and creates a directory with that name.

When the directory is made a prompt will appear indicating that you must place media+subtitle file into the new folder, they can be called 
whatever so long as they have mp4/avi/srt suffix

After files are placed hit enter and they SHOULD (emphasise on should) be renamed
